## Summary
The NYC Citi Bike program expereienced high activity in New York during the month of August 2019. Casual users use the service on the weekend. The majority of the rides were in the very busy Manhattan Island, taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours. The younger male population are the largest userbase of the bike sharing program. The bike sharing services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers and would be successful in Des Moines if the working demographic is centralized in a downtown area.
#### Suggestions for Future Analysis:
 - Analyze different months to determine trends.
 - Analyze different years to determine trends.
